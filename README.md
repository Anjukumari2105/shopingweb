## 📝 Project Description
Shop Smart — an e‑commerce web app that lets users browse products, add items to a cart, and place orders. It supports user accounts/login, shows product details, and offers a responsive design so it works well on mobile or desktop. Built to be easy to use and extendable — ideal as a base for a full online store.
